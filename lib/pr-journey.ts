 * The 10 PR Journey, as tracked state.

 * plus the five-field reflection; the server checks the URL against the GitHub
 * API (does it exist, did you actually open it, is it in the right kind of
 * repository) and only then records it as submitted. A reviewer with
 * `journey:review` signs it off.
 *
 * That order matters: the point of the workbook is that the claim on your CV is
 * backed by a link anyone can open.
