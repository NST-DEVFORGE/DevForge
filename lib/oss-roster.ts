/**
 * One roster for every open-source statistic on the site.
 *
 * Before this existed, the same list of contributors was hand-maintained in
 * four places — three API routes plus a second copy inside the PR-stats route
 * carrying typed-in PR counts. Adding a member meant four edits, and a missed
 * one silently dropped that person from a public page. The routes now all read
 * from here.
 *
 * Rosters are per year group. The second year is the founding batch and is the
 * union of two sources, deduped on the GitHub handle:
 *   - contributors below, which is the only hand-edited list left;
 *   - the live club roster in Firestore, so an approved member with a GitHub
 *     handle on their profile appears without anybody editing anything.
 *
 * It is a union rather than a straight switch to Firestore on purpose: several
 * people on the public stats pages are not (or not yet) approved rows in
 * Firestore, and quietly erasing them from the leaderboard would be a worse
 * bug than the one this replaces.
 *
 * The first year comes from the intake form instead, imported by
 * scripts/import-cohort-csv.mjs. Those students are not in Firestore yet, and
 * their numbers are read from a snapshot rather than counted live — see
 * lib/cohorts.ts for why.
